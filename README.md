## EATS GOOD

Eats good is an exciting and fun recipe sharing web app that allows users to browse and search for tasty recipes. Users who sign up and log in are able to create, edit and manage their recipes and manage their account.

## The Project

EATS GOOD was built in 3 days as part of a hackathon challenge where we utilised Git and Github source control tools to work collaboriatively (but safely) on our app. EATS GOOD is a Ruby on Rails web app deployed with Heroku. We utilised AWS S3 to handle our images.
